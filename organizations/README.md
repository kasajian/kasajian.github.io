## My organizations

* **[ramp-up](https://github.com/kasajian-rampup)** 
  * My tech memory.  I can't remember anything.  My notes to help me ramp-up to different technologies
* **[zumalifeguard](https://github.com/zumalifeguard)**
  * Various snippets â€” A wiki of stuff: some code, philosophy, but mostly random nonsense
* **[ether](https://github.com/kasajian-ether)**
  * Code and stuff thrown into the ether
* **[unorganization](https://github.com/Unorganization)**
  * Colleciton of live repos (mostly private) with no particular organizaiton -- almost all uninteresting to you
* **[stuff I deleted](https://github.com/kasajian-archived)**
  * I don't delete stuff.  I archive permanently because the world doesn't have enough junk
